# Why did I make this little project?
### When learning about Plotly express for Data Visualization I loved how versatile and interactive it was. It could plot maps of the United States not only by its states but ALSO by local counties!
### Whereas, for India I found little to no material provided by default. After browsing a few articles I located the required geojson files and included them in my Chorlopleth graph. 
### One could take data of multiple other years and add it to the animation. Only taking 2 years was a decision on my part since the project was more for displaying the capabilities of this geojson file.
